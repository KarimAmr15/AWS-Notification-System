Visibility Timeout and DLQ – Importance and Use

In an event-driven system, reliability is key. SQS’s Visibility Timeout and Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) features help ensure that failed messages are not lost and can be retried or inspected later.

Visibility Timeout temporarily hides a message from the queue once it's picked up by a consumer (Lambda). If the Lambda function fails to process it within this period , the message becomes visible again and can be retried.

To avoid infinite retry loops, we configure a DLQ. After a number of failed attempts (set by `maxReceiveCount = 3`), the message is sent to the DLQ (`OrderDLQ`). This prevents system clogging and allows debugging why certain messages failed.

Together, these features provide fault tolerance and observability in asynchronous processing systems.
